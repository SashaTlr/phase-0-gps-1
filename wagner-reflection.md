#What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I felt very comfortable with the git process, working alone. The GPS was valuable to see how it works with others. It revealed a couple potential hiccups in the process, but more importantly it shows how commit messages and the _request_ part of pull request works. As our mentor suggested, just because you push some new code, doesn't mean that it will be merged.

Also I see the value of the fetch-merge process as opposed to pull, which I was doing. I'm still a bit confused about one thing: where do the fetch-ed files exist on my local machine before being merged? I may hit up our guide in office hours later today for an answer.

#What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

The work flow of a pull request was clarified. Now I understand why it takes three button clicks to finalize it. And why there are options for adding further comments.

#What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

Oh lots of things. My pair and I initially asked each other about the git work flows we had been using up to that point. We confirmed commands and procedures. Then with our guide, we asked several questions about the pull request methods. We both were confused about the _making_ of the pull request, as opposed to just doing it all ourselves. Now, I think we both understand that a request is made, and another person will have to complete it.

#What still confuses you about git?

It remains a mystery to me how git manages all the files. But I don't need to know everything about how the sausage is made. Sometimes, it's like a philosophical paradox to accept that a single file can be different things in different branches. But I toyed with the system enough to see how it works on my machine. Once the files are committed to a branch, you can switch between branches and see the files change in the Finder. Crazy.

Though I'm now a bit mystified about fetch. Where do those files exist on my machine, and under what branch schema, before/until they are merged?

#How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

The session was great. It's hugely beneficial to have a smart person looking over our shoulders as we work. She was very supportive and positive. Granted that can't happen every day. But I'm so inspired by working with the other students. All of these experiences have been one of sharing, where we both teach each other something. I think one of the biggest challenges in the guided sessions is being prepared enough. I worry it's too time-consuming to have me read back the directions, for instance, as opposed to just jumping into the action. But I think working with a pair requires that both individuals have a shared vision of what that action is moving forward.
